I am happy that you have joined the growing community of learners at  \\nNMIMS. \\nShri Vile Parle Kelavani Mandal, a Public Trust and a Society in Mumbai since 1934 whose \\ngoal is to advance the cause of quality educa9on in India, set up Narsee Monjee Ins9tute \\nof Management Studies (NMIMS) in 1981 at the ini 9a9on of University of Bombay (now \\nUniversity of Mumbai). By 1994-95, NMIMS had emerged as one of the top 10 B-\\nSchools of India. Since then it has maintained its leadership posi9on in Management \\nEduca9on in India. NMIMS was also accredited by NAAC in 1999 at a 5 Star level and \\nsubsequently at  level “A’’. Based on the work University had done in Management \\nEduca9on, the Government of India conferred on it Deemed to be University Status \\nunder sec9on 3 of  the UGC Act in 2003. Since then NMIMS, as a University, has grown \\nmany fold, such that  today it o ﬀers programs in diverse Sciences, Architecture, Law, \\nEconomics, Business and  Commerce and these are over and above its con9nued \\ndominance in the ﬁeld of Management Educa9on where its Business School is today \\nconsidered one of the la crème de la crème. \\nOne of the primary objec 9ves of NMIMS is to in ﬂuence management prac 9ce through \\neduca9on, research and consul9ng interven9on. With a view to  educate corporate \\nprofessionals, the Institution offered courses both through campus and Distance Learning \\nmode. It was one of the few ins 9tu9ons that started oﬀering Management Programs at \\nCer9ﬁcate, Diploma and Post Graduate Diploma level in India, South East Asia and the  \\nMiddle East through distance learning model. However, over a period of 9me the \\nDistance Learning Division underwent changes curriculum, pedagogy and assessment.  \\nAfer becoming a University, NMIMS created a dedicated School for Distance Learning. \\nResponding to the new era of the 21\\nst \\ncentury, where technology has come to play an  \\nimportant role in the lives of an individual, we, at the University, felt that it was essen9al'),\n",

This would assist us in crea9ng an enabling learning \\nenvironment. \\nToday the School for Con9nuing Educa9on oﬀers courses using various learning \\ntechnologies which includes both computer and mobile. We also feel that educa 9on is \\nnot a one 9me ac9vity. Individuals have learning needs at diﬀerent stages of their life and \\ncareer. With this understanding the School of Distance Learning was renamed as School  \\nfor Con9nuing Educa9on. Technology has made Geography redundant and hence we felt \\nwe need to accordingly react this in our schools. NMIMS Global Access, which prefaces  \\nSchool for Con 9nuing Educa 9on, reacts such understanding. We believe learners and  \\nteachers can come from anywhere in the world. The dream for NGA – SCE is to leverage  \\nthe best resources available in the world to enhance learning experience of all those who \\njoin NMIMS NGA – SCE is yet another pedagogy tool for customized learning. \\nThe University has created a support structure to assist you in all academic ma iers. To \\nguide you through NMIMS Rules and Regula 9ons, a Student Resource Book has been  \\nprepared which is available on the website of NGA –SCE and the University. \\nI urge you to read it carefully and sign a student undertaking at the last page and submit \\nthe same to the Academic Coordinator at the 9me of learning kit from your University  \\nRegional Oﬃce and NMAT Test Centre. \\nFeedback is important for all living organiza9on.

I’m glad you have \\njoined us. \\nSVKM’s NMIMS is one of such ﬁrst genera9on Management Ins9tu9ons in this country, which has \\nlaunched Distance Educa 9on Programs for upgrading professional skills of those engaged in  \\nvarious corporate houses. The experience the School has gained so far with the corporate houses \\nhas further fuelled its commitment to introduce Online Educa 9on with the support of modern  \\ncommunication technologies. NMIMS has long posi9oned itself as a leader in reinven9ng business \\neduca9on. We believe the business leaders of the future must be globally compe 99ve and hold \\nmore holis9c views of business and leadership. Advances in technology and market forces make  \\nthe global economy extremely compe 99ve and hence management educa 9on has to have a  \\nglobal outlook, rigorous and mee9ng modern day challenges. \\nEveryone involved with NMIMS Global Access – School for Con 9nuing Educa9on (NGA – SCE) is  \\nworking towards a common goal of providing quality management educa9on to those who have \\nconstraints of 9me to a iend full 9me programs.

We have robust programs which are \\nveied by the industry experts. Our program content comes very close to full 9me management \\nprograms. With the advancement in technology, we strive to provide the best possible learning  \\nexperiences to meet the social commitments for higher and professional educa 9on of young  \\naspirants. Our programs are high on quality, rigor, and industry relevance. We are sure that these \\nprograms create value for the students, their organiza9ons and the society. \\nAt NGA – SCE, we have fully qualiﬁed and visi9ng faculty who interact with you con9nually along \\nwith the industry experts. We lay a lot of emphasis on the quality of our faculty.
